# 🎨 JAI Design System: "White Futuristic"
> **Core Theme:** High-Resolution Minimalism / Physicality / Citrus Glow
> **Version:** 1.0 (AgOS 2.0 Compliant)

This document defines the visual language of `jonnyai.website`, inspired by the "White Futuristic" architectural renders of the Spinnaker Tower and Honeytrap Lab.

## 🎨 1. Color Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Titanium White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background, high-lights. |
| **Ghost Surface** | `#F8F9FA` | Secondary backgrounds, cards, depth. |
| **Citrus Glow** | `#d97757` | Primary accent, status indicators, calls to action. |
| **Deep Void** | `#0a0a0a` | Typography (headings), dark-mode overrides. |
| **Steel Grey** | `#333333` | Body text, subtle borders. |

## 🏗️ 2. Visual Hierarchy

- **Surface Depth:** Use `box-shadow` with very large blur and low opacity to create "soft elevators". Avoid hard borders.
- **Frosted Glass (Glassmorphism):** Apply `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` to sidebars and mobile menus over "high-key" white backgrounds.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headings:** `Outfit` (Ultra-bold, 800) - Wide tracking (letter-spacing).
    - **Body:** `Inter` (Light, 300/400) - High readability.

## 🌊 3. Motion & Interaction

- **Fluid Entrances:** Content should fade in and slide up simultaneously with a "spring" ease (Duration: 0.8s).
- **The "Citrus Pulse":** Active calls-to-action should have a subtle, slow breathing glow effect.
- **Surface Hover:** Cards should lift slightly and expand their shadow on hover.
- **The Architect's cursor:** Custom cursor (minimalist dot) that expands when hovering over interactive elements.

---

## 🖼️ 4. Imagery Guidelines

- **Style:** High-key architectural photography.
- **Composition:** Minimalist, centered, or following the golden ratio.
- **Filters:** Low saturation, high brightness, slight blue/civil cooling.
- **Subject Matter:** Empty futuristic labs, minimalist workstations, abstract white titanium structures.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Component Standards

- **Buttons:** Sharp corners (radius: 2px), solid citrus background, white bold text.
- **Inputs:** White background, invisible borders, steel grey focus indicator.
- **Nodes:** Information should be presented in "Data Nodes"—minimalist boxes with single-pixel glows.
