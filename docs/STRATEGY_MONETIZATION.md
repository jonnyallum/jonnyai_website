    - **Imagery:** Hyper-real, architectural renders of "The Lab".

## 🤖 4. The "Resident AI" Integration
We will implement **"The Architect (v2.0)"** directly into JonnyAI.com:
- **Capabilities:** Can navigate the site for the user, pull case study data, and generate instant custom quotes via a "Proposal Engine".
- **Interface:** A floating minimalist glass orb or a sidebar "Console".
- **Agentic Power:** Integrated with **Manus** (Tool Discovery) so it can actually perform "mini-audits" of a visitor's website in real-time to show off expertise.
