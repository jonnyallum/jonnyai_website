# 📜 Deployment Sign-Off: God-Tier UI Refresh

## 🎯 Objective
Upgrade the JonnyAi.co.uk website from a standard MVP to a "World-Class" premium AI studio presence using AgOS 3.0 / Jai.OS 4.0 aesthetics.

## 🛠️ Work Summary

### 1. Global Foundation
- [x] **Neural Noise Texture**: Localized SVG noise pattern applied globally for cinematic depth.
- [x] **Brand Tokens**: Codified `citrus`, `obsidian`, `electric-purple`, and `neon-cyan` into Tailwind v4 theme.
- [x] **Utility Classes**: Created `.glass-card`, `.btn-glow`, and `.text-gradient-citrus`.

### 2. Header & Navigation
- [x] **Glass Pill Nav**: Replaced static header with a floating, blurred glass pill that detaches on scroll.
- [x] **Active States**: Enhanced navigation links with citrus underlines and hover glows.

### 3. Hero Section
- [x] **God-Tier Headline**: Scaled typography to `text-7xl+` with balanced line-height.
- [x] **Atmospheric Lighting**: Added radial glows and animated status pulse.
- [x] **Social Proof**: Integrated live count stats with high-contrast labels.

### 4. Service Architecture
- [x] **Interactive Spotlight**: Implemented JS-driven mouse tracking for Service Cards.
- [x] **Premium Cards**: Applied multi-layered glass shadows and refined borders.
- [x] **Tier Highlighting**: Distinct visual hierarchy for DFY vs Venture tiers.

### 5. Orchestra Showcase
- [x] **Roster Parity**: Reconciled census from 39 to 42 agents to include all specialized verticals.
- [x] **Agent Grid**: Upgraded the team section with high-res headshots (where available) and automated fallback logic.
- [x] **Build Fix**: Resolved `agentsByTier` export error preventing CI/CD success.

### 6. Call to Action & Footer
- [x] **Impact Typography**: Massive, balanced headlines on final CTA.
- [x] **Floor Glow**: Cinematic lighting effect added to the footer base.
- [x] **AgOS 4.0 Active**: Verified copyright and registry markers.
