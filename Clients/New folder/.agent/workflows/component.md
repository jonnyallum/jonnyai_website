### Instruction
Use this when you need a new UI component. This workflow calls **Finn** and **Remi** to collaborate.

### Steps
1. **Remi** audits the requirement for SaaS "2026" aesthetic.
2. **Vera** provides the approved design tokens (colors, spacing).
3. **Finn** implements the component using Vanilla CSS and the tokens.
4. **Sam** reviews the component for injection or security risks.
5. Save the output to the appropriate project directory.
