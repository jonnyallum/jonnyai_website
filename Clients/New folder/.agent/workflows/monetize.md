# /monetize - Offer Validation Workflow

## Purpose
Test if people will pay for something BEFORE building it. Money on the line = real validation.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Idea Validation (@Forge + @Scout)

1. **Problem Discovery**
   - @Scout: Research target audience pain points
   - @Forge: Identify urgent, painful, frequent problems
   - Output: Problem statement + target segment

2. **Offer Crafting**
   - @Forge: Define the "Irresistible Offer"
     - WHO: Specific target customer
     - WHAT: Core transformation/result
     - PRICE: Initial price point (start high)
     - GUARANTEE: Risk reversal

3. **Competitive Analysis**
   - @Scout: Find 3-5 competitors
   - @Forge: Identify differentiation angle

### Phase 2: Money Test (@Pixel + @Echo + @Jonny AI)

4. **Landing Page Creation**
   - @Pixel: Design high-converting landing page
   - @Echo: Write compelling sales copy
   - @Jonny AI: Implement with Stripe checkout
   - @Goldie: Optimize for target keyword

5. **Traffic Strategy**
   - @Clippers: Create short-form video ads
   - @Goldie: Organic SEO play (if time permits)
   - @Forge: Define ad spend budget

### Phase 3: Validation (@Metric + @Forge)

6. **Launch Test**
   - Run traffic to landing page
   - Track: Visits, Signups, Checkout attempts, Purchases

7. **Analyze Results**
   - @Metric: Generate conversion report
   - @Forge: Interpret results
     - **PASS:** >3% conversion → Build product
     - **ITERATE:** 1-3% conversion → Tweak offer/copy
     - **PIVOT:** <1% conversion → New angle or new idea

8. **Decision Point**
   - @Conductor: Route to build phase or back to ideation
   - @Archivist: Document learnings

### Phase 4: Build (If Validated)

9. **MVP Development**
   - @Jonny AI: Build minimum viable product
   - @Pixel: Polish core user flows
   - @Sentinel: Test critical paths

10. **Launch & Scale**
    - @Deploy: Ship to production
    - @Metric: Track revenue metrics
    - @Helpline: Handle customer success
    - @Forge: Plan upsells and retention

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Landing page conversion | >3% | Build product |
| Cost per acquisition | <1/3 of price | Scale ads |
| Refund rate | <10% | Product-market fit |

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T DO)
- ❌ Build full product before validation
- ❌ Rely on "interest" or surveys (only money counts)
- ❌ Ignore negative signals
- ❌ Skip the landing page and go straight to building

## Success Criteria
- Money received before product built
- Clear demand signal (not just "likes")
- Repeatable acquisition channel identified
