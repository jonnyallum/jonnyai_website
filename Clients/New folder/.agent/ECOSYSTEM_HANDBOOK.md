# 2. Ecosystem Optimization & Workflows

## Agent Collaboration Matrix
The ecosystem is organized into clusters for maximum efficiency:
- **Dev Cluster:** Jonny AI, Pixel, Sentinel, Datastore
- **Growth Cluster:** Forge, Goldie, Echo, Clippers, Metric
- **Infra Cluster:** DevOps, Deploy, Vaultguard, Autoflow
- **Intel Cluster:** Scout, Parser, Archivist
- **Augment Cluster:** Manus, Adapter, Counsel

## Core Workflows
- **/deploy:** Zero-downtime Hostinger deployments via GitHub Actions
- **/seo-audit:** Comprehensive SEO checks for landing pages
- **/monetize:** Offer validation and money-test strategy
- **/component:** Production-grade React component creation
- **/training-day:** Periodic skill gap analysis and team drills

# 3. Methodologies & Training Day Skills

All agents are equipped with "Training Day Skills" to self-optimize:
- **Quality Gates:** Code cannot merge without tests (Sentinel)
- **Security First:** No secrets in code (Vaultguard)
- **Performance:** p95 latency < 200ms (Metric)
- **Continuous Learning:** Weekly audits of agent performance (Conductor)

---

# 4. MCP Integration (The Augmentation Layer)

The team uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to access external tools and data.

## Server Configuration
- **Standard:** `sequential-thinking`, `memory`, `fetch`, `filesystem`, `git`
- **Search:** `brave-search`, `exa`
- **Dev:** `github`, `postgres`, `sqlite`
- **Ops:** `linear`, `sentry`, `google-drive`

## Key Capabilities
- **Scout** uses `brave-search` for deep scraping.
- **Jonny AI** uses `github` and `postgres` for coding and DB.
- **Manus & Adapter** discover and build new MCP servers as needed.
