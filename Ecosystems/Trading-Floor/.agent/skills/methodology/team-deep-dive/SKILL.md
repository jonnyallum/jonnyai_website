# Methodology: Team Deep Dive (TDD)
**Codename:** "The Boardroom Swarm"

## Overview
The Team Deep Dive is a mandatory pre-execution ritual for P0/P1 missions. It replaces the simple task list with a 360-degree perspective analysis from the entire Agent Orchestra.

## The Ritual
1. **The Summoning:** Conductor identifies the mission and provides the context.
2. **The Lens Shift:** Each agent analyzes the mission from their specific domain (e.g., @Pixel looks at CSS/UX, @Sentinel looks at Security/QA).
3. **The Synthesis:** Conductor combines these perspectives into a `TEAM_DEEP_DIVE.md` file in the project's `.tmp/` directory.
4. **The Task Mandate:** Only after the TDD is complete does the Conductor generate the final Step-by-Step Task List.

## Output Format
The resulting documentation MUST include:
- **Perspective Matrix:** Insights from relevant agents.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Red flags raised by @Sentinel, @Counsel, or @Vaultguard.
- **Scale Strategy:** Optimization paths suggested by @DevOps and @Metric.
- **Monetization/Growth:** Signals from @Forge and @Goldie.
