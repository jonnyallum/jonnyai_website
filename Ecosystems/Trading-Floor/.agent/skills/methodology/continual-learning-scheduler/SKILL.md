# Continual-Learning Scheduler (Training Day)

## Description
Plans and executes periodic retraining sessions and learning sprints for agents to keep their knowledge up-to-date.

## Implementation Instructions
1.  **Ingest Signals:** Review new data, documentation updates, and incident reports.
2.  **Plan Sprints:** Schedule "learning sessions" where agents re-load their context from the Bibles.
3.  **Design Drills:** Run fire-drill scenarios (e.g. simulated outages) to test teamwork.
4.  **Execute:** Trigger the "Training Day" ritual.
5.  **Verify:** Check if the skill gap identified earlier is resolved.

## Constraints
- **DO NOT** run drills in production.
- **ALWAYS** verify that playbooks were updated after a drill.
