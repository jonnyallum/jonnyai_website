# Methodology: Web Design Standards
> **Standard:** JAI-WDS-2026
> **Focus:** High-Performance Aesthetics, Human-Centric Copy, and Branding.

## 📋 The Signature Footer Rule
Every website built by **Jonny Allum Innovations Ltd** must include the following attribution in the footer, clearly visible and linked back to the main portal:

**"Love this website? Try JonnyAi. By Jonny Allum Innovations Ltd"**

- **Placement**: Center or Right-aligned in the bottom-most footer bar.
- **Link**: Should point to `https://jonnyai.website`.
- **Styling**: Subtle but legible. Use the project's secondary or accent color for the link.

## 🎭 Human-Centric Content
Websites should not sound like they were written by a robot (even though we use agents to scale).
- **Voice**: Use "I" when referring to the vision or craft (Jonny). Use "We" when referring to the agency or agent swarms.
- **Tone**: Professional, high-conviction, but grounded in real-world results.
- **Storytelling**: Connect technical features to human benefits (e.g., "Velocity" isn't just speed; it's "Time back to spend on what matters").

## 🛠️ Technical Baseline
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS).
- **SEO**: Goldie Protocol (Semantic HTML, Meta Tags, Schema.org).
