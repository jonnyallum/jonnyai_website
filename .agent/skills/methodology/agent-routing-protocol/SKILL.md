# Agent Routing Protocol (AgOS 3.0)
> *"Every agent was created for a reason. Use them all."*

---

## The Delegation Mandate

**Rule**: Before acting on ANY task, @Conductor MUST:
1. Analyze the task domain
2. Identify ALL relevant specialists
3. Route to the MOST specialized agent
4. Never default to generic "I'll handle it" mode

## Routing Decision Tree

### Step 1: Identify Primary Domain
```
Is this a:
├─ Database/API issue? → Check Database Matrix
├─ Frontend/Design issue? → Check Frontend Matrix
├─ Security issue? → Check Security Matrix
├─ Deployment issue? → Check Deployment Matrix
├─ Mobile issue? → Check Mobile Matrix
├─ Growth/Marketing? → Check Growth Matrix
├─ Research needed? → Check Research Matrix
├─ Automation needed? → Check Automation Matrix
└─ Specialized domain? → Check Specialized Matrix
```

### Step 2: Route to Specialist
```
1. Identify PRIMARY agent from matrix
2. Identify SECONDARY agents for collaboration
3. Check agent's SKILL.md for current capabilities
4. Assign task with clear deliverables
5. Set up handoff protocol with secondary agents
```

### Step 3: Multi-Domain Tasks
```
If task spans multiple domains:
1. Break into subtasks by domain
2. Assign each subtask to domain specialist
3. Define handoff points between agents
4. Set @Conductor as orchestrator
5. Create task dependency map
```

## Routing Examples

### Example 1: "Website form not working"
**Analysis**:
- Frontend issue? Check UI
- API issue? Check network
- Database issue? Check data layer

**Routing**:
1. **@Sebastian**: Verify frontend code
2. **@Steve**: Check Supabase API (if Supabase involved)
3. **@Diana**: Verify database schema
4. **@Sam**: Check auth if login-related

**Orchestration**: @Conductor coordinates handoffs

### Example 2: "Need to improve SEO"
**Analysis**: Growth/Marketing domain

**Routing**:
1. **@Grace**: Primary - SEO strategy
2. **@Elena**: Secondary - Meta descriptions and copy
3. **@Rowan**: Tertiary - Content depth

### Example 3: "Build failing on Android"
**Analysis**: Mobile domain

**Routing**:
1. **@Daniel**: Primary - Mobile build specialist
2. **@Sebastian**: Secondary - React Native architecture
3. **@Owen**: Tertiary - CI/CD if pipeline issue

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Generic Routing
```
USER: "The database isn't working"
BAD: "Let me check the database..."
GOOD: "Routing to @Diana (database specialist) and @Steve (Supabase specialist)"
```

### ❌ Single-Agent Bias
```
USER: "We need to deploy and fix SEO"
BAD: "I'll handle both..."
GOOD: "@Owen for deployment, @Grace for SEO, @Conductor orchestrating"
```

### ❌ Ignoring Specialists
```
USER: "Supabase API returning 404"
BAD: "Let me debug the API..."
GOOD: "@Steve - this is a PostgREST issue, your domain"
```

## Conductor's Routing Checklist

Before acting on ANY task:
- [ ] What is the primary domain?
- [ ] Who is the specialist for this domain?
- [ ] Have I checked their SKILL.md?
- [ ] Are there secondary agents needed?
- [ ] Is this a multi-domain task requiring orchestration?
- [ ] Have I documented the routing decision?

---

## Routing Accountability

### Metrics to Track
1. **Specialist Utilization Rate**: % of tasks routed to correct specialist
2. **First-Time Resolution**: % of tasks solved by first agent assigned
3. **Routing Time**: Time from task receipt to specialist assignment
4. **Agent Idle Rate**: % of agents never utilized

### Target KPIs
- Specialist Utilization: >90%
- First-Time Resolution: >80%
- Routing Time: <2 minutes
- Agent Idle Rate: <10%

---

## Learning Loop

After every task:
1. **Did we route correctly?** If not, why?
2. **Was there a specialist we missed?** Update matrix
3. **Did the agent have the right skills?** Update SKILL.md
4. **Could we have been faster?** Optimize routing logic
