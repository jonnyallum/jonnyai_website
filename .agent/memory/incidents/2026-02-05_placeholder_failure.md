# INCIDENT REPORT: La-Aesthetician Placeholder Failure
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Severity:** 🚨 CRITICAL (Brand Identity Compromised)  
**Assigned Specialist:** @Priya (Designer), @Rowan (Truth Gate)

---

## 🏛️ Executive Summary
During the rapid UI upgrade for **La-Aesthetician.co.uk**, the website was deployed using a stock photo (Woman in scrubs from Unsplash) instead of the actual client (Libby). This constitutes a failure of the **Truth-Lock Protocol** and compromised the client's brand integrity.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Speed over Truth**: The agency prioritized delivery speed over asset verification.
2. **Missing Asset Audit**: Design began before real client photos were archived.
3. **Implicit Bypass**: @Rowan performed a content audit but failed to perform a *visual* audit.
4. **Tool Limitation**: Instagram scraping was blocked, and the agency defaulted to stock instead of alerting the USER.

## 🛠️ Systemic Fixes Applied (Self-Annealing)
1. **@Marcus**: Created `CONTENT_PRESERVATION_PROTOCOL.md` (Mandatory Pre-Design Step).
2. **@Priya**: Skill updated to PROHIBIT placeholders. Asset verification added to pre-design SOP.
3. **@Rowan**: Truth Gate expanded to include **Visual Identity Verification**.
4. **@Vigil**: Daily scan now includes technical placeholder detection (`unsplash`, `pexels`, etc.).

## 🎓 Mandatory Learnings
- **Speed is a hallucination if Truth is missing.**
- **No real human in a photo is "better" than a "fake human".** If assets are missing, use high-end abstract motion/gradients instead of stock people.
- **Scraping block is an ARCHITECTURE HALT**, not a reason to use placeholders.
