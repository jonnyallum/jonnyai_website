# Implementation Plan - Mission: Multi-Site God-Tier Upgrade

> **Status:** Draft | **Owner:** @Conductor
> **Context:** Upgrading and polishing multiple client sites with accurate content, "God-Tier" UI, and consistent Agent attribution.

## 1. User Goal
- **Village Bakery**: Transform into a "World-Class" cafe site. Focus on charity work (food challenges, school breakfasts), promote Facebook/TikTok, fix mismatched photos, and remove all "artisan/sourdough" claims.
- **L-A Aesthetician**: Upgrade to "World-Class" with Instagram video embeddings.
- **Dudley Motors**: Tiny UI tweak + Agent Footer.
- **BL Motorcycles**: Polish + Agent Footer.
- **Leak Detection Local**: Polish + Agent Footer.
- **DJ Waste & CD Waste**: Final polish + Agent Footer.
- **Global**: All sites must include a "Built by the Antigravity Agent Orchestra" footer.

## 2. Proposed Architecture & Attribution
- **Footer Component**: A standardized, premium footer across all sites.
- **Content Accuracy**: Use Facebook/TikTok for real-time content and photo validation.
- **Tech Stack**: Most sites are Next.js 14/15 + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.
